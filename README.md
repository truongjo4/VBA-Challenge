# VBA-Challenge

## Background
VBA scripting used to analyse generated stock market data.

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `VBA-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Inside the new repository that you just created, add any VBA files that you use for this assignment. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

* (test.xlsx) - a draft spreadsheet I used to test the script

* (FinalData_AllYears_JohnnyT.xlsx) - My final spreadsheet containing the finished script.

* (tickeranalysis.vbs) - Final VBA script for viewing separately

## Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

 Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
 
 
Bonus Analysis:

* Create another summary table for the following variables and their corresponding ticker name and value:

   - Greatest % Increase
   - Greatest % Decrease
   - Greatest Total Volume
